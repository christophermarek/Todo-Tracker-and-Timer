# TODO

## Priority
* Create todolist component

--handle this now
* React authentication handling
* Implement backend
  * User Schema
    *username, password, do base first then we can do oAuth after
  * Front end sign up and login forms. Model and controllers setup first though.

  * Authentication
  * I want to preserve the main route, maybe if user is not authenticated then they just get autoredirect to login form



* Implement backend tracking for time tracker
  * Write schema for time model

* Decide how to implement the categories for time tracking


# COMPLETED
* Setup react
* Create nav bar component
* Create time tracker component. NO BACKEND YET
  * // Redo logic for time tracker
  * // I want two buttons under the timer
  * // Start and stop 
  * // Start and pause function first
  * //input needs to clear when timer finished
