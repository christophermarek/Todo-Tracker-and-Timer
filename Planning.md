# Design planning

Single page application

Personal dashboard application.
Your dashboard page should be made up of user selected modules.
ie a user selects what module goes onto their own dashboard
-a todo list module. This module hold a personal todo list 
-timer module, pomodoro timer or normal clock timer that you can set. Saves amount of time worked
-time tracker module. Maybe this should be built in to the timer module, or this could be a graphing module
-milestone module. This will display user defined milestones, and the users progress on those modules.

User can switch to individual pages for each module

## Front End

### Nav bar
Do this website need a navbar. To login and logout maybe
Maybe it will contain the links to route each module on the dashboard?
For now I think just a logout button will suffice

## Back End
